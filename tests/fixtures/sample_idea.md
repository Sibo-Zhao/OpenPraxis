# Product Idea: Practice Mode for Personal Knowledge Bases

## Concept

Instead of only highlighting and bookmarking when reading notes and articles, the system periodically "quizzes" the user: generating 2–5 minute micro-practices (explain, compare, design decision) based on note content. Users answer verbally or in writing, then receive feedback and insight cards.

## Hypotheses

- Users are willing to spend 2–5 minutes per session to "put knowledge to use."
- LLM-generated questions and evaluations are acceptable in quality and cost-effective.
- Insight cards (gap types, upgrade patterns, micro-practices) can drive sustained revisits.

## Validation Plan

- Start with 10-person internal beta: 5 notes per person → generate 3 questions each → collect completion rate and NPS.
- If completion rate > 60% and NPS > 30, proceed to build MVP.
